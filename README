   An Eclipse CDT plug-in for Seams and Mock Objects
                   by Michael Rüegg

1. Description
==============

Breaking dependencies is an important task in refactoring legacy
code and putting this code under tests. Feathers' seams help us
in this task because they enable us to inject dependencies from
outside. Although seams are a valuable technique, it is hard and
cumbersome to apply them without automated refactorings and tool
chain configuration support. We provide sophisticated support for
seams with Mockator, a plug-in for the Eclipse C/C++ development
tooling. Mockator creates the boilerplate code and the necessary
infrastructure for the four seam types object, compile, preprocessor
and link seam.

Although there are already various existing mock object libraries for
C++, we believe that creating mock objects is still too complicated
and time-consuming for developers. Mockator provides a mock object
library and a Eclipse plug-in to create mock objects in a simple yet
powerful way. Mockator leverages the new language facilities C++11
offers while still being compatible with C++98/03.


2. Project Layout
=================

The project is organized as follows:

* `source` contains the plug-in, feature, update site and test
  projects and the C++ Mockator mock object library

3. Build
========

We use Maven (minimum version is 3 because we use Tycho) to build
the project artifacts:

        $ cd source
        $ ./build.sh

creates all the artifacts.
