\section{Introduction}
Automated unit testing supports high quality of program code, even under inevitable change and refactoring. As a side effect, unit tested code often has a better structure. Java developers are used to unit testing because of JUnit and its tight integration into IDEs like Eclipse. C++ programmers lacked the tool support for easy-to-use unit testing, even though the language's complexity asks for it. Refactoring and simplifying C++ code without tests is very hard.
