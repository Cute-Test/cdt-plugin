<h1>Mockator - Refactoring Towards Seams and Mock Object Support for Eclipse CDT</h1>
<p>Breaking dependencies is an important task in refactoring legacy code and
putting this code under tests. Feathers' seams help us in this task because they
enable us to inject dependencies from outside. Although seams are a valuable
technique, it is hard and cumbersome to apply them without automated
refactorings and tool chain configuration support. We provide sophisticated
support for seams with Mockator, a plug-in for the Eclipse C/C++ development
tooling. Mockator creates the boilerplate code and the necessary infrastructure
for the four seam types object, compile, preprocessor and link seam.</p>

<p>Although there are already various existing mock object libraries for
C++, we believe that creating mock objects is still too complicated
and time-consuming for developers. Mockator provides a mock object libraray
and a Eclipse plug-in to create mock objects in a simple yet powerful way. 
Mockator leverages the new language facilities C++11 offers while
still being compatible with C++98/03.</p>
